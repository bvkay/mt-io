UoA Collection
==============

Collection of Earth Data PR6-24 (EDL) files combined into runs.

EDL writes one ASCII file per channel into day-numbered folders
(001-366), named ``{station_prefix}YYMMDDhhmmss.{CHANNEL}``. The recorder
also drops a ``config/recorder.ini`` describing the channel layout and
sample rates, which is used here when present.

    """
    Collection of EDL PR6-24 files into runs based on start and end times.

    Run names are assigned as ``sr{sample_rate}_{index:0{zeros}}``, e.g.
    ``sr10_0001``. A new run is started wherever the recording is not
    contiguous.

    :param file_path: full path to a station directory holding day folders
    :type file_path: string or :class:`pathlib.Path`
    :param survey_id: survey id, default is 'uoa'
    :type survey_id: string

    :param dipole_length_ey: Ey dipole length in metres

    .. note:: EDL ASCII files carry no header, so the sample rate comes from
     ``config/recorder.ini`` or from the `sample_rate` argument. The station
     id is taken from each file name, so a mid-deployment rename shows up as
     two stations rather than being silently merged.
