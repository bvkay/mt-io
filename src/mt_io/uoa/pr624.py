PR6-24
=======

    * reads Earth Data PR6-24 (EDL) ASCII files into a RunTS
    * builds the University of Adelaide sensor and interface response

The PR6-24 is a three- or six-channel 24-bit field datalogger. UoA MT
systems paired it with external magnetic sensors, electrodes and analogue
interface electronics. It writes one file per channel, named
{station}YYMMDDhhmmss.{CHANNEL}, either in day-numbered folders (001-366)
or flat. File length is set at acquisition time by mseed_filesize in
recorder.ini, so it varies between deployments.

The recorder writes either ASCII or miniSEED to the same file names, so
the format is detected from the first record header rather than the
extension. Both hold input voltage in microVolt. ASCII carries no header,
so its rate comes from recorder.ini, the caller, or the gap between
consecutive file stamps, snapped to a rate the instrument supports.
miniSEED carries rate, start time and sample count of its own.

Filter gains, physical to recorded:

    hx, hy   nT    -> uV    142.857         (Bartington Mag-03)
    hz       nT    -> uV    142.857 * 0.4   (15k/10k divider to the logger)
    ex, ey   mV/km -> uV    L * 10          (dipole length, terminal box)

Broadband systems use LEMI-120 coils with a normalized .rsp response, so
the flat-band 400 mV/nT sensitivity is carried as a separate filter.
